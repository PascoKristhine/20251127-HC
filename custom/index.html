                    Fort Santiago (Spanish: Fuerte de Santiago; Filipino: Moóg ng Santiago), built in 1571, is a citadel
                    or castle built by Spanish navigator and governor Miguel López de Legazpi for the newly established
                    city of Manila in the Philippines. The defense fortress is located in Intramuros, the walled city of
                    Manila.

                    The fort is one of the most important historical sites in Manila. Several people died in its prisons
                    during the Spanish Empire and World War II. José Rizal, the Philippine national hero, was imprisoned
                    here before his execution in 1896. The Rizal Shrine museum displays memorabilia of the hero in their
                    collection and the fort features, embedded onto the ground in bronze, his footsteps representing his
                    final walk from his cell to the location of the actual execution.<br>

                    It is only a few meters away from the Manila Cathedral and the Palacio del Gobernador (lit.
                    Governor's Palace, currently the office of the Commission on Elections).

                    The Rizal Shrine, also known as the Museo ni José Rizal Fort Santiago (transl. Museum of Jose Rizal
                    in Fort Santiago), is a museum dedicated to the lifework of José Rizal. It is located inside Fort
                    Santiago in Intramuros, Manila, Philippines, beside the Plaza de Armas. Fort Santiago served as
                    barracks for Spanish artillery soldiers during Spain's colonization of the islands. The museum is
                    located in the building where Rizal spent his final night and hid his famous poem Mi último adiós
                    (My Last Farewell) in an oil lamp later given to his sister, Trinidad. The shrine is home to various
                    memorabilia such as the shells he collected in Dapitan, books, manuscripts and artwork.<br>

                    In 2014, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines renovated the museum in order to
                    attract younger audience.

                    José Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda (Spanish: [xoˈse riˈsal, -ˈθal], Tagalog: [hoˈse
                    ɾiˈsal]; June 19, 1861 – December 30, 1896) was a Filipino nationalist, writer and polymath active
                    at the end of the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines. He is popularly considered a national
                    hero (pambansang bayani) of the Philippines. An ophthalmologist by profession, Rizal became a
                    writer and a key member of the Filipino Propaganda Movement, which advocated political reforms for
                    the colony under Spain.<br>

                    He was executed by the Spanish colonial government for the crime of rebellion after the Philippine
                    Revolution broke out; the revolution was inspired by his writings. Though he was not actively
                    involved in its planning or conduct, he ultimately approved of its goals, which eventually resulted
                    in Philippine independence.<br>

                    Rizal is widely considered one of the greatest and most influential figures in the Philippines, and
                    has been recommended to be so honored by an officially empaneled National Heroes Committee. However,
                    no law, executive order or proclamation has been enacted or issued officially proclaiming any
                    Filipino historical figure as a national hero. He wrote the novels Noli Me Tángere (1887) and El
                    filibusterismo (1891), which together are taken as a national epic, in addition to numerous poems
                    and essays.
